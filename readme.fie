qs 1) Var, let, const:
Var is old and works in functions, let is for variables I can change, const is for values that don’t change.

qs 2) Map, forEach, filter:
Map makes a new array, forEach just loops through, and filter gives a new array with only the items I want.

qs 3) Arrow functions:
Arrow functions are short functions using => and they don’t have their own this.

qs 4) Destructuring:
Destructuring is a way to take values from arrays or objects and put them in variables.

qs 5) Template literals:
Template literals use backticks and let me put variables inside strings with ${}. It’s easier than adding strings with +.
