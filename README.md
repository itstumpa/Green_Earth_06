#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?


qs 1) Var, let, const:
Var is old and works in functions, let is for variables I can change, const is for values that donâ€™t change.

qs 2) Map, forEach, filter:
Map makes a new array, forEach just loops through, and filter gives a new array with only the items I want.

qs 3) Arrow functions:
Arrow functions are short functions using => and they donâ€™t have their own this.

qs 4) Destructuring:
Destructuring is a way to take values from arrays or objects and put them in variables.

qs 5) Template literals:
Template literals use backticks and let me put variables inside strings with ${}. Itâ€™s easier than adding strings with +.
